# internet-crawl
Crawls a set of linked pages. Solution to GE Providence Coding Challenge

To execute the JAR from the command line, do the following:

java -jar internet-crawl-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar "C:\JobPrep2\internet-crawl\src\main\resources\Internet1.json"

You can pass one or both JSON files in as parameters. Separate the parameters with a space. I had the project in a folder called C:\JobPrep2. You should use your own file path as appropriate.
